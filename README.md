# Azure Static Website

### Overview

This repository contains the source code for a static website hosted on
[`Azure Storage Account`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).
It utilizes `Azure Static Website` functionality to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly from storage, without the need for a web server. This approach is cost-effective and suitable for basic websites.
